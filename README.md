## API Integration

The chatbot integrates with Google's Generative Language API (Gemini). The API is called when a user submits a message, with the response then being displayed with a typing effect for a more natural experience.

```javascript
const API_URL = `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent?key=${API_KEY}`
```

## Responsive Design

The interface is built with a mobile-first approach, featuring:

- Fluid typography that scales based on device size
- Adaptable layout for screens as small as 320px
- Touch-friendly controls for mobile users
- Optimized scrolling for suggestion cards on small screens

## Future Enhancements

- Export conversation feature
- Image generation capabilities
- Custom user preferences
